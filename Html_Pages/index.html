				<h2>About E-Commerce</h2>
					<p>E-commerce is the activity of buying or selling of products on online services or over the Internet. 
						Electronic commerce draws on technologies such as mobile commerce, electronic funds transfer, supply chain management, 
						Internet marketing, online transaction processing, electronic data interchange (EDI), inventory management systems, and 
						automated data collection systems. Modern electronic commerce typically uses the World Wide Web for at least one part of 
						the transaction's life cycle although it may also use other technologies such as e-mail. Typical e-commerce transactions 
						include the purchase of online books (such as Amazon) and music purchases (music download in the form of digital distribution 
						such as iTunes Store), and to a less extent, customized/personalized online liquor store inventory services.[1] There are three 
						areas of e-commerce: online retailing, electric markets, and online auctions. E-commerce is supported by electronic business.
